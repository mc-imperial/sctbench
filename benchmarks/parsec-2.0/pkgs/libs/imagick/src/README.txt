ImageMagick® is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap
images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats
(about 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD,
PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip,
mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors,
apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses
and Bézier curves.

The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command
line or you can use the features from programs written in your favorite
programming language. Choose from these interfaces: G2F (Ada), MagickCore
(C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++
(C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), nMagick (Neko/haXe), MagickNet
(.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand for PHP
(PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK). With
a language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images
dynamically and automagically.

ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary
distribution or as source code that you can freely use, copy, modify,
and distribute. Its license is compatible with the GPL. It runs on all
major operating systems.

Here are just a few examples of what ImageMagick can do:

    * Format conversion: convert an image from one format to another (e.g.
      PNG to JPEG)
    * Transform: resize, rotate, crop, flip or trim an image
    * Transparency: render portions of an image invisible
    * Draw: add shapes or text to an image
    * Decorate: add a border or frame to an image
    * Special effects: blur, sharpen, threshold, or tint an image
    * Image calculator: apply a mathematical expression to an image or image
      channels
    * Text & comments: insert descriptive or artistic text in an image
    * Image identification: describe the format and attributes of an image
    * Animation: create a GIF animation sequence from a group of images
    * Composite: overlap one image over another
    * Montage: juxtapose image thumbnails on an image canvas
    * High dynamic-range imaging: accurately represent the wide range of
      intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the brightest direct
      sunlight to the deepest darkest shadows
    * Large image support: read, process, or write mega- and giga-pixel image
      sizes
